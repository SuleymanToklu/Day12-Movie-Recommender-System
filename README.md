# üé¨ Hybrid Movie Recommender System

This project is an interactive movie recommender system built with Streamlit, developed as part of my **#30DaysOfAI** challenge. The application utilizes a hybrid model to provide personalized movie suggestions based on both content similarity and collaborative filtering.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Hybrid Recommendation Engine:**
    -   **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends movies by comparing their textual features like plot, genres, keywords, and director using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity.
    -   **Collaborative Filtering:** Suggests movies based on the tastes of similar users, powered by the SVD algorithm.
-   **Interactive UI:** A user-friendly and modern web interface built with Streamlit.
-   **Multi-language Support:** The interface is available in both English and Turkish.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Usage

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/SuleymanToklu/Day12-Movie-Recommender-System.git](https://github.com/SuleymanToklu/Day12-Movie-Recommender-System.git)
    cd Day12-Movie-Recommender-System
    ```

2.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8501`. The pre-trained model files (`.pkl`) are included in the repository, so no training is required to run the app.
